# ðŸ“Œ Fully Automated Segmentation of Cervical Spinal Cord in Sagittal MR Images using Swin-Unet Architectures

Background/Objectives: The spinal cord is an essential component of the central nervous system. It contains nerve roots that transmit signals between the brain and various parts of the body. Although it is located in a partially protected area of the spine, the spinal cord is highly susceptible to trauma, tumors, infections, and inflammatory and degenerative diseases. Spinal cord damage can interrupt nerve conduction, resulting in severe functional impairment, paralysis, loss of muscle control, and sensory loss. Additionally, cancer or infections affecting the spinal cord can lead to numerous neurological complications. Therefore, accurate and complete spinal cord segmentation is of great clinical importance for revealing its structural features and assessing healthy nerve conduction. Methods: In this study, fully automated segmentation of the cervical spinal cord region using sagittal magnetic resonance (MR) images is performed to enable rapid clinical evaluation and support early diagnosis and treatment processes. The segmentation task utilizes the Swin-Unet architecture, which combines the powerful convolutional infrastructure of the U-Net architecture with vision transformer-based attention mechanisms. In particular, in order to distinguish the thin, curved and low contrast anatomical structure of the cervical spinal cord with high performance, the integration of swin transformer blocks into the encoder and decoder layers enables the efficient acquisition of both local details and global contextual relationships. Results: In experimental studies, the proposed Swin-Unet model, which uses transformer blocks in the encoder layer, achieved Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance 95 (HD95) scores of 0.9526 and 1.0707 mm, respectively, for cervical spinal cord segmentation. These results demonstrate that the model can consistently and effectively segment the cervical spinal cord in terms of both pixel and structural key metrics. Conclusions: Thanks to its structure enriched with attention mechanisms, the transformer-based Swin-Unet architecture has demonstrated a high level of success in segmenting thin and complex anatomical structures, such as the cervical spinal cord. Its ability to generalize in limited data strongly supports integrating it into diagnosis and monitoring processes in clinical applications.
